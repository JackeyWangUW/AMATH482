### This repository includes codes (MATLAB/ Python) and reports for the following topics:
- Homework 1: An ultrasound problem 
<p>In this report, we will see how Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Gaussian filter are being used in real life. In this problem set, Fourier transform will be used to convert a signal from time domain to the frequency domain. Gaussian filter will be used to filter out the noise from data. By using both techniques, we are able to determine the frequency signature, the path of an object in a noisy field, and its location at a given time.</p>

- Homework 2: G치bor transforms 
<p>In this report, we will perform experiments on G치bor Transform to see how different time filtering window widths and translations size affect the resolution in time and frequency components. We will also do the comparison between different G치bor windows. At last, we will see an application of G치bor Transform in real life by processing the song Mary had a little lamb on both the piano and recorder. </p>
  
-	Homework 3: Principal Component Analysis 
<p>In this report, we will see illustration of various aspects of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its practical usefulness and the effects of noise on the PCA algorithms in a real-world problem by extracting the motion information of a paint can in different cases.</p>

- Homework 4: Music Classification 
<p>In this report, we will see how Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) are being used together to train the computer to help us classify the different bands from different genres, different bands from same genre, and different genres. </p>

- Homework 5: Neural Networks for Classifying Fashion MNIST 
<p>In this report, we will see how artificial neural networks are being used as a machine learning tool in real life to classify fashion items. We will perform different neural network architectures with different hyperparameters and try to achieve the best accuracy on the validation data in order to classify ten fashion items.</p>
